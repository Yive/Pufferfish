Subject: [PATCH] Optimize suffocation

The isInWall check to determine suffocation is quite expensive, and
often is completely unnecessary to check. We do two things here to
improve this:

1. We only check for suffocation once per 20 ticks. The maximum
no-damage ticks value means that this change should be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, for players to notice.

2. We additionally execute a check to see if the player can even take
damage in the first place. This check doesn't improve performance much
but is so much cheaper than the suffocation check that it's worth
keeping it.
